\section*{Introduction}

\section*{Methods and Data}

\paragraph{16s Colony PCR} Each colony was picked and touched to 20ul of
alkaline PEG200 (``ALP'').  This was then boiled for 5 minutes to lyse
the cells. 1 ul of cell lysate was then added to a 25 ul Promega GoTaq
G2-based PCR reaction with the bacterial 16s primers 8F and 1391R.  16
rounds of PCR was performed with a 1.5 minute extension time.  After
PCR, bands were checked on a gel; then,
Sanger sequencing was performed directly from the PCR reactions with
the primer 515F.

\section*{Results and Discussion}

\subsection*{An enrichment from Trunk River grew with the addition of acetate}

I initially designed media to enrich for sulfur oxidizing denitrifiers
microbes (``BB+SN'').  I inoculated two Pfennig bottles (approx. 40ml)
with approximately 2-3 cc of material.  The material for the first
enrichment, culture 4, was taken directly from the sediment layer on
top of the sand in the main channel of Trunk River, approximately 8m
from the start of the narrow outflow channel. The material for the
second enrichment, culture 8, was taken from the underwater surface of
a sea table enrichment that originated from a microbial mat, also
taken from Trunk River.  Both enrichments were incubated at 30 deg
in a foil-lined box to prevent phototroph growth.

After 18 hours, significant turbidity was observed in both
enrichments, along with substantial amounts of supersaturated gas,
indicating growth.  I therefore transferred 1 ml from each enrichment
to another Pfennig bottle containing BB+SN.  These transfer
enrichments, however, failed to grow.

Based on scent, Dr. Leadbetter suspected that the original transfer of
sediment contained acetic acid, indicating the presence of significant
amounts of acetate.  I therefore added 800ul of 1M sodium acetate to
both enrichment cultures, to a final concentration of 20 mM.

After the addition of acetate, both transfers grew to white opacity
within about 16 hours at 30 deg.  Two subsequent transfers of each
culture (1ml into 40 ml ``BB+SNA'', BB with thiosulfate, nitrate, and
acetate) also exhibited similar growth.

\subsection*{Enrichments exhibited nitrate and acetate dependent growth}

To further analyze growth conditions, I employed a simple
``differential diagnosis'' approach and transferred each enrichment to
four culture conditions: BB, BB with thiosulfate and acetate (BB+SA),
BB with nitrate and acetate (BB+NA), and BB with acetate (BB+A).
After incubation for 16 hours, only the BB+NA grew, indicating that
the enrichments required both nitrate and acetate but not
thiosulfate (Figure~\ref{fig:diff}).

    nitrate and acetate-dependent growth (third column) in anaerobic BB medium. No growth was observed in base BB media, BB+thiosulfate and acetate, or BB+acetate.}
  \label{fig:diff}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Enrichments yielded colonies when grown on solid media}

I plated 1:500 and 1:5000 dilutions of enrichments 4 and 8 on BB+SNA
solid media, and incubated the plates both anaerobically and
aerobically at 30 deg.  I also plated the same dilutions on LB and
grew aerobically at 30 deg.  All plates showed density-dependent growth,
although the colonies on the LB plates grew much faster (2-4 times)
than either the aerobic or anaerobic BB plates.

\subsection*{Isolate colonies from aerobic LB plates grew successfully
  in anaerobic culture}

I picked 4 colonies grown aerobically on LB from each enrichment (for
a total of 8), and inoculated anaerobic BB+SNA cultures with them.
7/8 of the cultures grew within 48 hours, with three (culture 3 from
enrichment 8, and cultures 5 and 8 from enrichment 4) growing
overnight to opacity.

I then transferred these three isolates (3, 5, and 8) from BB+SNA
anaerobic liquid culture back to LB plates, where they again grew
(see Figure~\ref{fig:LB}).

\subsection*{Isolate colonies were identified by 16s colony PCR as {\em Shewnaella} spp.}

I picked colonies and performed 16s PCR on the eight LB isolate
colonies as described in the Methods.  All 8 yielded bands, which were
then Sanger sequenced.  BLAST of all 8 colonies against NCBI's ``nt''
database showed strong similarity (99\%) to two known species of
Shewanella (Table~\ref{tab:16s}).

\subsection*{Isolate cultures contain Spirilla-shaped microbes}

I examined all three cultures with light microscopy and saw
Spirilla-like bacteria (Figure~\ref{fig:spirilla}).  These bacteria
appeared to move in a corkscrew-like fashion.  This morphology is at
odds with their molecular identification as Shewanella spp, which are
typically rod-shaped bacilli.
